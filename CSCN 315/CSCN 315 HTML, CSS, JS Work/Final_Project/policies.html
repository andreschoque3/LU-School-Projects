        <article id="source_doc">
            <h1>List of Major Policies</h1>
            <h2>I. Operational Hours</h2>
            <p> The Library opens from 8:30 am until 5 pm. We do not accept any books
                that have been checked out after 5 or earlier than 8:30. We accept anyone who 
                has a valid library card. Library cards can be purchased at the front desk.
                anyone without a card will not be permitted.
            </p>
    
            <h2>II. Library Card</h2>
            <p> Library cards act as your 'badge' and ID for the library. This helps us identify
                who is using our services and it helps identify who are guests and non members.
                Guest cards can be obtained at the front desk.
            </p>
    
            <h2>III. Security</h2>
            <p> These are the following security measures we have implemented to keep
                everyone safe: cameras at every corner, multiple security guards around
                each study area and room. And surpervision from the front desk. 
            </p>
    
            <h2>IV. Emergency info</h2>
            <p> For your safety we are always making sure that everyone is safe. That is 
                why we implemented security measures such as cards and passes. We can to
                make sure there are no infiltrators and if they are we can monitor and 
                take care of business. If there are any suspicious activity please notify
                the front desk immediately. 
            </p>
    
            <h2>V. Book Policy</h2>
            <p> To checkout a book simply grab any book that you would like to check out.
                Once you have your book of your liking, go to the front office to check it
                out. You follow the directions that the front desk administrator tells you
                 and then you should be good to go. Checked books have a 2 month timeline.
                 You should return it afeter those two months or we will charge every day
                 after the date checked out. The fee increases 5 dollars every day. If
                 you would like to pruchase the book please do it online.  Unless otherwise
                 mentioned. You can take up to 8 books with you. You can check out online
                 on the checkout portal. 
            </p>
    
            <h2>VI. Study policy</h2>
            <p> Please be aware of your surroundings and be mindful of other people.
                Please do not be a distraction towards other people. People come in
                to take a break and read, or to work diligently on their work. Please
                do not cause any problems with your fellow neighbors or you will be 
                asked to leave the library. Study and reading spaces are meant for
                only that. 
            </p>
    
            <h2>VII. Reserving Study Rooms</h2>
            <p>Reserving study rooms can be done online or at the front desk. Always
                state why you need to reserve a study room. This is due to high demand.
                If we catch you doing other things we will kick you out of the room and
                give it to the next person. 
            </p>
    
            <h2>VIII. Reserving Conference Rooms</h2>
            <p>The procedure to reserve a conference room is through the online
                portal. Conference rooms cannot be reserved at the front desk since
                they need anticipation. Please check our available time slots.
            </p>
    
            <h2>IX. Food and Drinks</h2>
            <p>The Library will not tolerate any food or drinks being consumed
                at any room. Please refrain from eating since it causes distractions
                and it is hard on the custodians.
            </p>
    
            <h2>X. Noise at the Library</h2>
            <p> People at any room should have an inside voice. The only
                exemptions are the study and conference rooms. But we would
                also politely ask to monitor your voice levels. If you speak
                very loudly or make intruptions you will be kicked out.
