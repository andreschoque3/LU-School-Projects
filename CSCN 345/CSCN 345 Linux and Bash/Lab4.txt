Bash Script

Write a Bash script called newmv (to replace the linux command mv) that tries to rename the specified file (using the Linux command mv)

Remember that if the destination file exists, the program should instead create an index number (a sort of version number) to append the destination file.
So if I type ./newmv a.txt b.txt
But if b.txt already exists, newmv will move the file to b.txt.1

Note that if b.txt.1 already exists, you must rename the file to b.txt.2, and so on until you can successfully rename the file with a name that does not already exists.

If the source and destination files are not specified on the command line, exit gracefully with an error message

upload lab4 (newmv.sh) make it executable.

code:

vi newmv.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Checks if the file does not exists

if [ -f new.sh ]; then
  mv new.sh /jchoquegarcia
fi

#END
