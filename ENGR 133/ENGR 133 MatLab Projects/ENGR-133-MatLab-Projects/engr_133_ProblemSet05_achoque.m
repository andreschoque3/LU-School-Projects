Create a MATLAB function called fxy to evaluate the function f(x,y) defined as 
follows:
f(x,y)= {xy if x>=0 and y>=0 
         xy^2 if x>=0 and y<=0 
         x^2y if x<=0 and y>=0 
         x^2y^2 if x<0 and y<0

Test your function for all four cases.

a. An ideal diode blocks the flow of current in the direction opposite that of 
the diode's arrow symbol. It can be used to make a half-wave rectifier, shown as
in figure P28a. For the ideal diode, the voltage vL across the load RL is given
by vL = { Vs if Vs > 0
          0 if Vs <= 0
suppose the supply voltage is
  Vs(t) = 3e^-t/3 sin(pi*t)V
where time t is in seconds. Write a MATLAB program to plot the voltage vL versus
t for 0 <= t <= 10.

b. A more accurate model of the diode's behavior is given by the offset diode
model, which accounts for the offset voltage inherent in semiconductor diodes.
The offset model contains an ideal diode and a battery whose voltage equals the
offset voltage.
